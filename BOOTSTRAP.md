# Bootstrapping instructions

This file documents the brief instructions for bootstrapping a fresh copy

If you have GNU Autoconf installed, first try to type `autoreconf --install`
in this directory to generate a `configure` script and other build files. 
If it failed, install the required packages and do it again.
