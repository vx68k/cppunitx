## File encoding

Unless required by the media type, a file SHOULD be encoded in either `UTF-8` or `US-ASCII`.
If the media type allows each file to declare its encoding, it is RECOMMENDED to use `UTF-8`.

Unless required by the media type, a file encoded in `UTF-8` MUST NOT contain byte order marks.

## End-of-line convention

Unless required by the media type, each line of a file SHOULD end with a single LF character.
