# Guidelines for contributing

There are minimal guidelines for now.

## File encoding

Unless required by the media type, a file **SHOULD** be encoded in either `UTF-8` or `US-ASCII`.
If the media type allows each file to declare its encoding, it is **RECOMMENDED** to use `UTF-8`.

Unless required by the media type, a file encoded in `UTF-8` **MUST NOT** contain byte order marks.

## End-of-line convention

Unless required by the media type, each line of a file **SHOULD** end with a single LF character.
